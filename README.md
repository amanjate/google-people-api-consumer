This sample app manages Google Contacts

You are supposed to have a google account.
First, you will need to enable the People API
and get authorization credentials for a desktop application.
To learn how to create credentials for a desktop application,
refer to https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials.

Then, download and copy the credentials.json file to src/main/resources/
directory.

Now, you can test the app. Let me know what you think about.
